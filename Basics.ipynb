    "# Exploring Hacker News Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a new incubator site that runs in a similar fashion to Reddit. Users can submit posts and the community votes on whether they enjoy it or not. It is very popular in the technology and computer circle. The data we will be looking at today comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) and has been reduced in size from 300,000 posts to remove posts that did not receive any community interaction and then further reduced using a random sampling of 20,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, I want to take a look at two specific types of posts: the Ask Hacker News (Ask HN) and Show Hacker News (Show HN). Ask HN posts are just that, someone asks a question and the community provides answers. Show HN posts are typically just a way for a user to show an interesting web page, project, etc. to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information I want to learn is\n",
    "1. Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments?\n",
    "2. Is there an ideal time to post in order to receive the most comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, let's get started."
